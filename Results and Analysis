https://zenodo.org/record/3243160/files/mother_R1.fq.gz

### Step 2: Quality Control
In this project, after uploading datasets, quality check was performed for using FastQC tool. The FastQC tool gave the output with a good Phred score, which signifies those reads are of good quality. The following are the output of FastQC tool:

MultiQC tool was used to aggregate the results from FastQC into a single report. The following is the report generated by MiltiQC tool: [Click Here](https://usegalaxy.eu/datasets/11ac94870d0bb33af4176bff93c8de30/display/?preview=True)

### Step 3: Adapter Trimming
Following are the trimmed datasets:


### Step 4: Read Mapping
Mapping was performed using Map with BWA-MEM tool on fathers, mother’s and proband’s datasets with reference genome [hg19](https://zenodo.org/record/3243160/files/hg19_chr8.fa.gz). The following is the BAM file geneerated after mapping:

### Step 5: Mapped reads Post-processing
Mapped reads post-processing was performed to filter mapped reads and remove duplicate reads using Filter SAM or BAM, output SAM or BAM and RmDup tools respectively.

### Step 6: Variant calling
FreeBayes tool was used to call variants, which specifically finds SNPs, MNPs and Indels. The following is the VCF file output generated by FreeBayes tool: [VCF File](https://usegalaxy.eu/datasets/11ac94870d0bb33abfed7987f666ad78/display/?preview=True)

### Step 7: FreeBayes Post-processing
Post-processing FreeBayes calls was performed using bcftools norm, which normalizes indels and split multiallelic sites into multiple rows. The output of bcftools [Click Here](https://usegalaxy.eu/datasets/11ac94870d0bb33a8b119dfa8fbc57e5/display/?preview=True)

### Step 8: Variant Annotation
For variant annotation, SnpEff eff tool and SnpSift tool were used. 
- The following outputs were generated by SnpEff tool: [VCF File](https://usegalaxy.eu/datasets/11ac94870d0bb33a1c834c7cd24872a9/display/?preview=True) and [HTML File](https://usegalaxy.eu/datasets/11ac94870d0bb33a7494d8b78e339fa9/display/?preview=True)
- The outputs generated by SnpSift variant type tool were: [VCF File](https://usegalaxy.eu/datasets/11ac94870d0bb33aae1a1698a1085243/display/?preview=True) and [Log File](https://usegalaxy.eu/datasets/11ac94870d0bb33aa523d322c9cec1c5/display/?preview=True)

### Step 9: Generate GEMINI Database
The combined variant extraction/annotation/storage step was performed on SnpEff-annotated VCF by the GEMINI load tool. The output generated was [gemini.sqlite](https://usegalaxy.eu/datasets/11ac94870d0bb33a4d715cac7a041cb3/display/?preview=True)


### Step 10: Candidate Variant Detection
The inheritance pattern of the causative variants or candidate variant detection was performed using GEMINI inheritance pattern tool, which gave the following output file: [Tabular File](https://usegalaxy.eu/datasets/11ac94870d0bb33a87afa37da3585f2d/display/?preview=True)
